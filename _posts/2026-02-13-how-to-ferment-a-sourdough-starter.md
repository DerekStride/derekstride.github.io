title: How to Ferment a Sourdough Starter
excerpt: >
  A straightforward guide to creating and maintaining a sourdough starter from scratch,
  covering daily feedings, common ratios, and what to look for as your culture matures.

To ferment a sourdough starter, mix equal parts by weight of flour and water and leave the
mixture at room temperature. Feed the starter daily by discarding half, then adding fresh flour
and water in the same ratio. Within several days you should see bubbles and a pleasantly sour
aroma; continue regular feedings until the starter doubles in size reliably after each feed.

## Ratios

### 1:1 (by weight)

The simplest starting point. Combine equal weights of flour and water:

- 50 g flour
- 50 g water

This is all you need to get a starter going from scratch.

### 1:2 (maintenance, optional)

Once your starter is active, you can maintain it with a 1:1:1 ratio of starter to flour to
water:

- 50 g starter
- 50 g flour
- 50 g water

This keeps the culture healthy without building excess volume.

### 1:4 (to build volume)

When you need more starter for a bake, use a higher ratio of flour and water relative to the
seed:

- 25 g starter
- 50 g flour
- 50 g water

This gives the yeast and bacteria more food to consume, producing a larger batch of active
starter.
