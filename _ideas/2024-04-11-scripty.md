title: Scripty – Share Scripts via GitHub Gists
excerpt: >
  A CLI for sharing single-file scripts between developers. Storage backed by GitHub Gists, with import/update/sync workflows for lightweight collaboration.
---

A tool to share small scripts between teams without the overhead of a dedicated git repo. GitHub Gists as the storage backend gives you versioning, web UI, and collaboration for free.

## The Problem

Sometimes you have a useful script—a one-off data migration, a build helper, a debugging tool. It's too small for its own repo, but copy-pasting it around is messy. Email attachments rot. Slack snippets get lost.

Gists are perfect for this, but the workflow is clunky: create gist in browser, copy URL, clone locally, edit, push. Scripty wraps this into simple commands.

## Commands

**`scripty share <file>`** – Upload a local file to a new gist. Returns a shareable URL. Tracks the file→gist mapping in `~/.config/scripty/config.toml`.

**`scripty import <gist-url>`** – Clone someone else's gist to your local machine. The gist becomes a local file you can run and edit.

**`scripty update`** – Push local changes back to the gist. If you imported someone else's script, this forks it to your own gist (you can't push to theirs).

**`scripty sync`** – Pull the latest remote changes and merge with your local edits. Git merge semantics—conflicts are possible if both sides changed.

## Why Gists

- **Versioned** – full git history for every script
- **Web UI** – view, comment, fork in browser
- **API** – GitHub's gist API is simple and well-documented
- **Free** – unlimited public gists, private gists with GitHub account
- **Familiar** – developers already know gists exist

## Implementation

Rust CLI using:
- `clap` for argument parsing
- `reqwest` for GitHub API calls
- Config stored in TOML at `~/.config/scripty/config.toml`

Each tracked script maps a local filepath to a gist ID. Import clones the gist repo locally. Update/sync use git operations under the hood.

## Open Questions

- Multi-file gists? Gists support multiple files, could be useful for script + config pairs
- Private gists by default? Public is more shareable, private is safer for internal tools
- Conflict resolution UX? Git conflicts in a single-file context might need special handling
