    Master your defaults. The gap between stimulus and response is where clear thinking happens—or doesn't.
---

Clear Thinking is about what happens in the space between stimulus and response. Most of the time we don't think at
all—we react. Our defaults take over. Parrish argues that mastering these defaults is the key to better outcomes.

> People who master their defaults get the best real-world results. It's not that they don't have a temper or an ego,
> they just know how to control both rather than be controlled by them. With the ability to think clearly in ordinary
> moments today, they consistently put themselves in a good position for tomorrow.

The book is organized around identifying the enemies of clear thinking, then building strength and managing weakness to
overcome them.

## The Four Defaults

Parrish identifies four biological defaults that hijack our thinking:

> 1. The emotion default: we tend to respond to feelings rather than reasons and facts.
> 2. The ego default: we tend to react to anything that threatens our sense of self-worth or our position in a group
>    hierarchy.
> 3. The social default: we tend to conform to the norms of our larger social group.
> 4. The inertia default: we're habit forming and comfort seeking. We tend to resist change, and to prefer ideas,
>    processes, and environments that are familiar.

These aren't character flaws—they're features of human biology. The goal isn't to eliminate them but to recognize when
they're taking over.

## The Stimulus-Response Gap

> In the space between stimulus and response, one of two things can happen. You can consciously pause and apply reason
> to the situation. Or you can cede control and execute a default behavior. ... So our first step in improving our
> outcomes is to train ourselves to identify the moments when judgment is called for in the first place, and pause to
> create space to think clearly.

This connects directly to habit awareness in [Atomic Habits](/books/atomic-habits)—the first step before you can change
a habit is noticing the cue that triggers it.

## Environment Over Willpower

One of the most practical insights: don't fight your defaults with willpower. Change your environment instead.

> What may look like discipline often involves a carefully created environment to encourage certain behaviors. The way
> to improve your defaults isn't by willpower but by creating an intentional environment where your desired behavior
> becomes the default behavior.

This reinforces the core message from [Atomic Habits](/books/atomic-habits): design your environment to make the right
behavior easy and the wrong behavior hard.

## HALT

A simple check before making decisions:

> HALT—an acronym that stands for Hungry, Angry, Lonely, and Tired. Ask yourself whether any of these conditions apply.
> If so, deal with the real problem first.

Originally from Alcoholics Anonymous, but broadly applicable. Don't make important decisions when your defaults are
primed to take over.

## Decision-Making Principles

Parrish offers several practical principles for better decisions:

**The 3+ Principle:**
> Force yourself to explore at least three possible solutions to a problem. If you find yourself considering only two
> options, force yourself to find at least one more.

**The Bad Outcome Principle:**
> Don't just imagine the ideal future outcome. Imagine the things that could go wrong and how you'll overcome them if
> they do.

**The Definition Principle:**
> Take responsibility for defining the problem. Don't let someone define it for you. Do the work to understand it. Don't
> use jargon to describe or explain it.

**On Low-Stakes Decisions:**
> When the stakes are low, inaction hurts you more than speed. Sometimes it's better just to make a quick choice and not
> spend time deliberating.

## Handling Mistakes

> The four steps to handling mistakes more effectively are as follows:
>
> 1. accept responsibility
> 2. learn from the mistake
> 3. commit to doing better
> 4. repair the damage as best you can

## Self-Knowledge

> When you play games where other people have the aptitude and you don't, you're going to lose. You have to figure out
> where you have an edge and stick to it.

Know your strengths, play where you have an advantage.

## Learning From Experts

> People at the far right of the bell curve (the positive outliers) can teach you tips, tricks, and insights that might
> otherwise take a lifetime to learn. They've done the heavy lifting. They've already paid for the lessons, so you don't
> have to.

Seek out exemplars. Learn from people who've already solved the problems you're facing.
